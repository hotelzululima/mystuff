Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js 
uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and 
efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open 
source libraries in the world.

This is the 4.x LTS version. LTS support will transition into maintenance on
